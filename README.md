# WAND-Top-k-Retrieval-Algorithm
Implementation of the WAND algorithm in python, used top-k retrieval in web search
### Usage: 
> `python3 tc[1-4].py`
or
> `WAND_Algo(query_terms, top_k, inverted_index)`
where query_terms is a list of strings, top_k is an integer and inverted index is a dictionary where terms point to a list of tuples [(doc_id, weight)]
